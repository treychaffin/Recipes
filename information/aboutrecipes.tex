Recipes attempt to follow nutrition guidelines set forth by the book:
\citetitle{bernstein_2011} \autocite{bernstein_2011}, although some recipes
do not.

The internet culinary world is bloated with ads and un-necessary backstories that distract the cook 
from following recipes. This document is meant to re-format internet-based recipes, as well as 
personal recipes, into a document that follows a simple format that enables the cook to quickly 
and efficiently find the information needed.
